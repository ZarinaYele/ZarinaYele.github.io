In class today we talked with Adam. In the beginning he talked about himself and his profession in general. It was interesting to hear about his life and experience. For us to communicate with him is a great honor, because he already knows a lot about video game design and can tell a lot about his profession or what challenges face the designers and of course to share with us your experience. We also asked our questions and got the answers. In the end, he gave advice for those who wanted to link their future with design games. And I want to thank him for what he has spent his time to talk to us and tell us about the design of video games.
