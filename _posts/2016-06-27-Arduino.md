### What is it?

 Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message.
 Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge.

### Why Arduino?

The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux.It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. 
-Inexpensive - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms.
-Cross-platform - The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems.
-Simple, clear programming environment - The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users.
-Open source and extensible software - The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. The language can be expanded through C++ libraries.

Today we started to work with Arduino. And I'll tell you it was cool and very interesting. In high school I went to robotics. Of course I heard about Arduino, but had not idea about it and even thought it is very difficult. Because our school was not Arduino. And today we worked with Arduino and I realized that it's not as difficult as it may seem. In Arduino we learn to program and build. In the beginning me and my partner Nurbol couldn't install apps, but then our teacher, miss Sheral helped us to set the program to run Arduino. And I think that this lesson will help me in the future deeper and to understand more about robotics.
