 Importance of each of them.

  1) The producer — the expert who takes part in regulations financial or legal aspects of activity. Also producer one of the most important people in team. Because he gives money for creation of the project.

  2) The engineer specialist performs engineering activities. I think engeneer One of the most important in the creatures of the game. Because engineers build major part of game. Is like a foundation of house. Without foundation will not a house.
  
  3) A designer is a person who designs. In practice, anyone who creates games is referred to as a designer. Designer creates the design of game. That is, if the game happens  in the house, then the designer's job to compose home's plan.
  
  4) The scientist — the expert in any scientific area who has brought a real contribution to science. The scientist develops game, also gives advice in order that more people played this game.
  
  5)The artist's work in game is make game more interesting and more exciting. Also artist draws game, that is he finishes work of the designer.
