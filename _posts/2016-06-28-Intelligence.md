### Artificial Intelligence (AI): 

1) science and technology for creating intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs; 

2) the property of intelligent systems to perform the creative functions that are traditionally considered the prerogative of man.

a) a person is not able freely to handle huge amounts of data 

b) to err is human 

c) human nature and laziness

## Where we used AI?
AI technology is increasingly prevalent in our everyday lives. It has uses in a variety of industries from gaming, journalism/media, to finance, as well as in the state-of-the-art research fields from robotics, medical diagnosis, and quantum science.
