## 1.What criteria must a game have?

There are criteria which apply to all games and those that apply to the "games with rules".

- Rules of game
- Winnig condition
- Story


### 1.1 Game rules

As already discussed, the rules and the components define the game. Everything that is in the rules is part of the game. Everything that is not in the rules does not belong in the game. The rules are the borders and the heart of the game. They only refer to the game and never exist outside of the game.

### 1.2 Winnig condition

Goals

This is the most general sort of victory condition, which can be broad enough to encompass any method of winning, but here refers to game-specific goals that are usually not duplicated in other games. An example is the checkmate of a king in chess.

Quest

A quest in role-playing video games—including massively multiplayer online role-playing games and their predecessors, MUDs—is a task that a player-controlled character, "party" or group of characters may complete in order to gain a reward.

### 1.3 Story
 
 Each game has its own story. Without a story the game would not be interesting. For stories to build the game itself.
